# Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis
This project seeks to scrape Cryptocurrency data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) and into a CSV file. Then, we will run some technical analysis on the data. Common trading strategies include momentum, mean reversal, and more. We would also like to be able to create a visualiation
dashboard to explore the data. We then would include this on our ANOVA github page.
We used the cryptocurrency index Crix as the market: http://crix.hu-berlin.de/
## Requirements

Python3 is required. All packages used are in the requirements.txt file.

### Getting Started

Most likely to use plotly to construct the dashboard: https://plot.ly/

Examples of good dashboards: https://plot.ly/dash/gallery/uber-rides/

First let's get this working on our own Jupyter notebooks.

Good tutorial to learn git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
